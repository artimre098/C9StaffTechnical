              <h5>Earn more revenue</h5>
              <p>Adobe VIP uses auto-renewal subscriptions providing resellers with a source of predictive cash flow. If a customer doesn't want the license renewal, simply reduce the number of seats in the ACMP before the deadline. Enjoy the use of the purchased licenses until the end date.</p>

              <h5>Invoice customers daily</h5>
              <p>Anticipate your cash flow with daily customer invoicing - and not monthly. Meaning if your customers have 244 days until the end date, they will be invoiced for the 244 days.</p>

                <p>No portal changes will happen for end customers. Your customers will continue to
                    access the same admin console meaning they won't even notice the change.</p>
